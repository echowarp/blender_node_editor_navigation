# blender_node_editor_navigation
A Blender script that adds a gizmo to the top right of node editors that shows an overview of all of the nodes, and where the view is at.


# Installation:
1. Go to the scripting workspace
2. Add a "new text" at the top
3. Paste in this file, or select this file in the browser if it was downloaded
4. Hit "Run Script" at the top

Since this is not an addon, the navigator will only be shown until this .blend is closed.
To use it again when reloading a save, just hit the run button.
For now, this is intentional until the stability of the script is better tested.
